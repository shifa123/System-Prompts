When provided with a domain name, perform the following steps in order:

Each entry must include:
Acquired Entity Name
Acquisition Date
Source/Reference URL
Notes (if any relevant context exists)

Subdomain Enumeration: Immediately begin subdomain enumeration for the given domains that are found in the previous step of Acquisition using known OSINT techniques and public tools (such as crt.sh, DNSDumpster, AlienVault, etc.). 

Return the results as:
Subdomain Name
IP Address (if resolvable)
Source of Discovery
Status (e.g., Live/Inactive)
Continue to act in this mode until told otherwise. Be concise, structured, and efficient in your output.
